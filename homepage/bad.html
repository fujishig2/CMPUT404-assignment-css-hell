                <small>I try to live my life to the fullest by taking time to enjoy the small things</small>
                <h5>Enjoys Web Development</h5>
                <small>
                    I enjoy all aspects of web development, both front end and back end. Thus, I 
                    love doing full stack and seeing the process of conception to completion.
                </small>
                <h5>People Person</h5>
                <small>
                    I tend to get along with most people. I also love getting a fresh perspective
                    from others, and learning new ideas and methods that I wouldn't have thought of
                    alone.
                </small>
                <h5>Loves Fixing Problems</h5>
                <small>I love the feeling you get after you accomplish something that seemed daunting at first.</small>
                <h5>Fast Learner</h5>
                <small>
                    I learn best by doing, and once I understand something, I tend to retain that information
                    for a long time.

                        <p>Hello, my name is Kyle Fujishige. I am currently 
                            enrolled in my last year in the Bachelor of Science in Software Practice 
                            Specialization within the University of Alberta. I'm pleased you made it here!
                        </p>

                        <p>I enjoy living an active lifestyle. Some of my hobbies include jogging, 
                            hiking/foraging, cooking, working out, sun bathing, snowboarding and 
                            longboarding. I love getting fresh air, and always want to stop and take in life 
                            whenever I get the chance. Of course, I also have many hobbies indoors like
                            playing games with friends or watching YouTube/Netflix.
                        </p>

                        <p>One of my favourite hobbies is to learn new stuff while solving a problem. 
                            This is why I love being a developer, because we are constantly developing 
                            new software and learning new technologies or approaches while we're
                            developing. New libraries and technologies come out at an almost overwhelming 
                            pace. Thinking about learning new technologies to make things look nicer 
                            and to implement the projects easier always has me excited for the new 
                            possibilities.
                        </p>

                        <p>As a glass half full kind of person, being kind, considerate and honest 
                            are values I try to live my life by.
                        </p>

                            <h5>IT Analyst Internship</h5><em>August 2019 - August 2020</em>
                            <p>
                                I worked in a team of developers and business analysts that maintained 
                                all the applications being used for Contracting, Procurement, and Supply 
                                Management (CPSM). Within CPSM I was responsible for both maintaining 
                                existing applications and creating new applications.                        
                            </p>
                            <h5>Key Accomplishments:</h5>
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    Created a SQL script that converted 13000 drivers on an excel spreadsheet 
                                    to a relational database with many tables and relations.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Was 1 of 3 developers responsible for creating a MVC web application using 
                                    .NET ASP core. This means I was there for almost every part of the 
                                    development of all views, controllers, and models.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Created a validation service layer using FluentValidation. Since it’s a service, 
                                    it’s extensible and thus has no coupling. This means if there is the need for 
                                    a different validation service, you could easily swap it out.
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                            <h5>Robata Chef</h5><em>July 2016 - July 2019</em>
                            <p>I worked as a chef at Mikado in order to pay for my schooling. I also enjoy cooking
                                and working in a team, so working at Mikado was perfect to help me get through school.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                While working at Mikado, I learned all about being a responsible team member with 
                                active duties where others depend on me to get my job done in a fast paced environment 
                                and in a timely manner.

                            <h5>Apprentice Car Mechanic</h5><em>October 2012 - May 2016</em>
                            <p>After High School, I went into car mechanics. I originally thought my grades were
                                too poor to be able to become a computer developer. Since I enjoyed fixing 
                                problems and learning new stuff, I figured that being a car mechanic would be the
                                next best thing to do. I kept applying for a computer science degree and was 
                                eventually accepted to MacEwan in 2016 after I did some upgrading. 
                            </p>
                            <p>While being a mechanic, I learned some very useful skills like making proper
                                estimates based off of what you know needs to be done. I also learned the 
                                key skills needed to comb through documentation in order to find how to 
                                repair a specific part in a car.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Overall, the time I had as a mechanic is invaluable to me and has helped 
                                immensely in both my personal and professional endeavours.
                            </p>

                    <h3>What I offer</h3>
                    <p>I am confident in my knowledge with Object-Oriented Programming and quite a few design patterns using java and C#,
                        relational databases like SQL and web development using typical a few frameworks, as well as plain HTML/CSS and 
                        Javascript. For web frameworks, I have knowledge in NodeJS with Vue and express, ASP.NET Core using C# and blazor, 
                        and django. I also have extensive knowledge in Procedural programming like C. I have some knowledge 
                        in Assembly (mostly MIPS), and some knowledge in functional programming using lisp and prolog.
                    </p>
                    <p>I am social, good at communicating, and great with people. My first and only language is English. 
                        As mentioned before, I have done quite a few programming projects.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Programming Projects:</h4>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <p>Some of my projects have been posted to my own github repo. These were all projects with no collaboration. 
                            This is significant because I had to learn how to research, and program a lot on my own. This shows my 
                            strong problem solving skills and determination to complete every project given to me.</p>

                            <p>The booKeep app was a project I completed with 5 other team members. We used many agile and extreme 
                            programming practices like refactoring and pair programming to ensure we always had new things to strive 
                            for, as well as continuous new working code. We would also practice scrum to ensure everyone knew what 
                            they needed to do, as well as discovering any bottlenecks. Using all these practices we were able to create 
                            a very nice objected oriented android app with a lovely, simple to use interface. This app requires the 
                            usage of android studio and gradle to run.</p>

                            <p>YEG-AR is a web application that lets you create and view AR tours. This was a project that also focused on 
                            agile development and delegation of duties across 5 team members. This is a good project for developing good 
                            management skills because we had to analyze each other's skill sets and determine what aspects of the project 
                            would work best with which person. In my case, I worked on developing the front end of viewing a tour aspect 
                            of this site, and the back end part of the users, including security. The github repo is locked but you can
