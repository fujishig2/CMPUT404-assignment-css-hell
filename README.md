Part 1
======
For 1.html, the only modifications I made was removing all the content
within style tags and adding a link to my own file, part1.css within 
the head tag. I also linked the Google fonts style satisfy, as recommended 
within the Google fonts docs, found here: 
https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Satisfy?query=satisf&preview.text_type=custom.

For 2.html, I removed all the content in the style tags, linked part1.css 
to it, and linked the google fonts styles for satisfy, as recommended within 
the Google fonts docs, found here: 
https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Satisfy?query=satisf&preview.text_type=custom. 
I also replaced the img src tag from src="/images/cover.jpg" to 
src="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/140/140-h/images/cover.jpg" on line
37.

For 3.html, I removed all the content in the style tags and linked part1.css 
to it, and linked the google fonts styles for satisfy, as recommended within 
the Google fonts docs, found here: 
https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Satisfy?query=satisf&preview.text_type=custom. 
I also replaced the img src tag from src="/images/('content.jpg')" to 
src="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/203/203-h/images/('content.jpg')" on 
lines 57, 2575, 7862, 13084, 17284, 24171, and 26007.

For Part 1 I did neither collaboration, nor did I reference external
sources. I used my own css knowledge to do all of part1.css

Part 2
======
Most of the external code will be found in: https://www.w3schools.com.

The sidebars and screen responsiveness was created by utilizing the code
found here:
https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_sidebar_responsive.asp and
https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_responsive_floats.asp

I did set the background color and transparency but maintained image
opacity by using stackoverflow advice over here:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28169502/prevent-image-transparent-inside-a-transparent-div

Most of the basic stuff like borders, background images, etc. were 
stuff I already knew.
